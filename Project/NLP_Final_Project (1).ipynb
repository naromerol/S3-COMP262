       "5239  i bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage  i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d28 but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitarsimagine my profound disappointmentreally boss this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours  this thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the top control higher than about 9 oclock  at first i thought i must have a defective unit but then i started reading reviews online  seems like it is part of the design its too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones hidden beneath a wall of fizz totally unusable as far as im concerned by the way i tested it direct to a pa as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "8631  i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds this was my first fender amp as wellthe presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard models just the amp model no effects just to see how its clean sound was the amp just hissed as if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max the master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on ive never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there was no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes very distracting and it drove me nuts this isnt a ground loop issue my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond its clearly a defect with this product dirty presets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume youd think i was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil but nothing was plugged in and all i get is staticyhiss at low levels wtfthe next issue is the weird fizz sound that was especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note theres a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surrounds the note and fades as the string stops moving it almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored mp3 file at a low bit rate and frequency whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayablethe weird thing is neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in or when this was connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but im not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my pc or cans i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted 12 celestion speakerread the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitaramp related websites theres a 65 page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and youll find that these amps are having issues apparently the mustang i and ii dont have these issues and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problems but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesnt seem to caredefinitely try this before you buy it you may get an amp that doesnt have these problems you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care let your ears tell you what sounds goodthis amp has a lot of potential for great sounds and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps but in my opinion technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage i am disappointed that fender hasnt yet correct what ever is wrong some folks claim that fender reps say that know what is wrong but im not taking that as a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrongwhatever i took this back after a few days of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success the builtin noise gate helps a little but sucks tone and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead guess what the clean channel has zero hum or buzz even when cranked how about that even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels there is minimal noiseill knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amps that id like to try but before i buy another fender amp ill take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds\n",

       "5239  i bought this pedal new hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage i knew going in that it would not sound like a martin d28 but i thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic part without having to switch guitarsimagine my profound disappointmentreally bos this is by far the worst pedal i have ever used of yours this thing ha a terrible hiss when you turn the top control higher than about 9 oclock at first i thought i must have a defective unit but then i started reading review online seems like it is part of the design it too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tone hidden beneath a wall of fizz totally unusable a far a im concerned by the way i tested it direct to a pa a well a into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar strat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "8631  i purchased this amp locally and initially i thought it wa pretty cool a it wa my first modeling amp lot of potential for a limitless variety of sound this wa my first fender amp a wellthe presets were neat and all but when i played around with some of the standard model just the amp model no effect just to see how it clean sound wa the amp just hissed a if i had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max the master volume wa at 2 and no effect were turned on ive never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it even when there wa no guitar plugged in all i could hear while playing wa the underlying hiss coming through the note very distracting and it drove me nut this isnt a ground loop issue my other amp sound just fine at bedroom volume and beyond it clearly a defect with this product dirty presets with lot of gain and extra volume sound even worse again even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume youd think i wa running a few super high gain stomp box with a red hot single coil but nothing wa plugged in and all i get is staticyhiss at low level wtfthe next issue is the weird fizz sound that wa especially noticeable on the low e after striking a string instead of a clean note there a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that surround the note and fade a the string stop moving it almost sound like cymbal crashing on a poorly authored mp3 file at a low bit rate and frequency whole chord break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really make this thing unplayablethe weird thing is neither one of these problem arose with head phone plugged in or when this wa connected to my computed via either usb or the line in but im not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my pc or can i got the iii instead of the ii because of the power behind it and the touted 12 celestion speakerread the many review online or forum post on many of the guitaramp related website there a 65 page forum post on the fender support site that is quite interesting and youll find that these amp are having issue apparently the mustang i and ii dont have these issue and the firmware update did nothing to correct my amp is this a hardware issue software issue speaker issue there is speculation that the lcd screen which is not present on the i or ii may be causing problem but no one seems to know for sure and fender doesnt seem to caredefinitely try this before you buy it you may get an amp that doesnt have these problem you may not notice the sound or you may not even care let your ear tell you what sound goodthis amp ha a lot of potential for great sound and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amp but in my opinion technical issue have made this amp sound like complete garbage i am disappointed that fender hasnt yet correct what ever is wrong some folk claim that fender rep say that know what is wrong but im not taking that a a fact but they have acknowledged that there is something wrongwhatever i took this back after a few day of playing with it trying to eliminate the junk sound without success the builtin noise gate help a little but suck tone and i picked up a 100 watt marshall instead guess what the clean channel ha zero hum or buzz even when cranked how about that even when i engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channel there is minimal noiseill knock fender for not correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it but they do have some other nice amp that id like to try but before i buy another fender amp ill take it for a test drive and i suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turd   \n",

       "4253  i ordered one of these because i like my other planet wave capo a lot i believe it the older metal version of this not the 34lite34 however this one just doe not screw down enough to hold down the string especially down at the lower fret where the neck is a little thinner on a martin jumbo acoustic it will barely bend the string down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chord tooim not sure why the plastic version ha this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one it doesnt seem defective a no part are bent or missing a far a i can tell unless i just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw i wouldnt recommend it for any guitar without a thick neckmy recommendation is the classic kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove it also attache to your headstock effortlessly when not in use if you are looking for the screwdown style i would look for the older version of this and avoid the 34lite34                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "5595  i am a tone freak i bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff at the time i had never owned a big muff i thought the sound it produced wa big muff sound i later took it to my friend house and matched setting with a real big muff the difference wa huge the big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box i later bought a big muff and it been one of my go to pedal for at least three year of gigging i am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sound anything le than the real deal i would only use the little big muff if my concern for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "8666  i have been through a few delay pedal trying to get the sound i want1 bos digital delay i really didnt like the sound of the delay overall no real positive to mention2 carbon copy analog delay worked great for clean but totally muddied up my lead distortion tone even though it wa in my fx loop i couldnt get the repeat to duck under the main signal3 nova delay i really wanted to like this presets tap tempo and a nice feature set but the sound just lacked warmth it wa very digital soundingat this point i wasnt sure what i wanted analog delay were warm sounding but too mushy digital delay were clear sounding but just too digital and uninspiringi wa debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline when i found this pedal analog dry signal thru with digital delay this is what the magic sauce is in my opinion now my signal ha the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved set it to the 2290 type delay and it perfect sure it doesnt have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay this cant be beat at this price rangesure enough when i checked the strymon timeline spec i found out that it too ha the analog dry through with digital delay just that it delay may be modeled better and it ha a rich feature set but 450 for a delay pedal is just too much for mebuy this if you are chasing tone you wont be disappointed skip if looking for presets tap tempo etc   \n",
